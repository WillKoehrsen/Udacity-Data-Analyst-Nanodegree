    "OpenStreetMap (OSM) is an open-source project attempting to created a [free map of the entire world](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=2/54.3/7.6) from volunteer-entered data. It is maintained by the [OpenStreetMap foundation](https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Main_Page) and is a colloborative effort with over 2 million contributors. OpenStreetMap data is freely available to download in many formats and presents an ideal opportunity to practice the art of data wrangling for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The entire dataset is user-generated meaning there will be a significant quantity of \"dirty\" data\n",
    "* The dataset is for any area is free to download in many formats including XML\n",
    "* The data are relatable and human-understandable because they represent real places and features\n",

    "The first step was to download the map as an XML file. The original file clocked in at nearly 5.5 million lines, which was somewhat unwieldy for testing the first versions of auditing and cleaning scripts. Consequently, I decided to create smaller sample XML files for the first runs of the auditing scripts and for identifying the most common problems that would need to be cleaned. Using a provisional sampling script, I created a small file that contained one out of every 100 top-level element, and an intermediate size script that kept one out of 10 top-level elements. There are three core, top-level elements in OSM:\n",
    "1. [Nodes](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Node) represent a single point and have an id, latitude, and longitude. They may also contain descriptive tags that elaborate on the node if it is on an item of interest\n",
    "2. [Ways](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Way) are made up of ordered lists of nodes that describe a linear feature such as a trail, or an area such as a park. They contain a list of the nodes that comprise the way as well as tags for detailed information.\n",
    "3. [Relations](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Relation) are comprised of an ordered list of members that can be either nodes or ways. They are used to represent logically or geographic relationships between features and contain a list of members as well as tags describing the element."

    "### Data Auditing and Cleaning Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Being in control of a large dataset can be both exciting and intimidating! There are numerous possiblities for exploration, but the sheer amount of information can be overwhelming. Before I officially began any data wrangling, I wanted to have a step-by-step plan in order to efficiently go through the process of auditing and cleaning the data. I decided on the following approach, adapted from the Udacity course on Data Wrangling:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Audit the data: identify errors/missing or generally \"dirty\" data in the original XML file\n",
    "2. Create a data cleaning plan based on the audit\n",
    "    * Identify the causes of any inconsistent/incorrect data \n",
    "    * Develop a set of corrective cleaning actions and test on a small sample of the XML data\n",
    "3. Implement the data cleaning plan: run cleaning scripts and transfer the cleaned data to .csv files\n",
    "4. Manually correct as necessary: import the data from .csv files to a SQL database and perform SQL queries on the data to identify any further inconsistencies that would necessitate returning to step 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "Data wrangling is an iterative procedure, and as such, I expected that I might need to work through these steps several times. Moreover, I knew that having a clear outline of the procedure to follow would save me untold hours of work and confusion.\n"

    "#### Elevation\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the official documentation for [elevation data in OpenStreetMap](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Altitude), elevation in tags should be recorded in meters. Furthermore, from the [United States Geological Survey list of elevation of major cities](https://egsc.usgs.gov/isb//pubs/booklets/elvadist/elvadist.html), I can see that the elevation of Cleveland ranges from 571' at the lowest point to 1050' at the highest point. Therefore, after converting to meters, all elevation data encoded in node tags should be between 174 m and 320 m. This would be a test for both uniformity, because all elevation data should use the same units, and accuracy as I was checking the elevations against a trusted source. The following code was used to find elevation points outside of the acceptable range and invalid elevations:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python \n",
    "\n",
    "def audit():\n",
    "\tsuspect_elevations = []\n",
    "\tinvalid_elevations = []\n",
    "\n",
    "\tfor _, elem in ET.iterparse(map_file):\n",
    "\t\tif elem.tag == 'tag':\n",
    "\t\t\tif elem.attrib['k'] == 'ele':\n",
    "\t\t\t\ttry: # Try to convert the elevation to an integer\n",
    "\t\t\t\t\televation = int(elem.attrib['v'])\n",
    "\t\t\t\t\tif elevation > 320 or elevation < 124: # Elevation limits in meters identified from the USGS\n",
    "\t\t\t\t\t\tsuspect_elevations.append(elevation)\n",
    "\t\t\t\texcept: #\n",
    "\t\t\t\t\tinvalid_elevations.append(elem.attrib['v'])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The audit identified any elevations above or below those measures, as well as any elevations that could not be cast to an integer. I could have used regular expressions to identify problematic characters, but since I expected all the elevations to be integers, the simpler approach was to attempt to cast all the elevation data to integers. This initial effort yielded 2516 suspect elevations and 5 problem elevations in the entire dataset. I decided that assuming all the elevations above or below the accepted limits were false was a mistake. The USGS data was for the city of Cleveland itself, and my map included surrounding areas. Therefore, I took a closer look at the suspect elevations. The four highest values were [1188, 423, 419, 414] and the four lowest were [3, 3, 42, 321]. I decided that 423 m was a reasonable elevation for the surrounding area of Cleveland. However, clearly the 1188 was meant to be in feet, and the three lowest points were not realistic. I made the choice to eliminate the three lowest elevation tags and convert the largest value to meters. The elevations with bad characters were ['318;313', '304.5', '298.4', '679\"', '348;352;358']. I decided to take the first elevation listed if there were multiple entries and convert the entry in feet to meters. Total, this meant I only had to correct 9 problem elevations out of 6500. That makes me confident that the accuracy and uniformity of the dataset was initially very high. \n",
    "\n",
    "The actual cleaning of the elevation data would take place when I converted the XML into CSV files. I created a mapping for correcting the elevations and implemented it in the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "# The main data cleaning script will drop the tag if it encounters an empty string\n",
    "elevation_mapping = {'3': '',\n",

    "An additional audit I could perform for accuracy was on the postal codes (also known as ZIP codes in the United States for Zone Improvement Plan). My approach with the postal codes was to find a complete and trusted list of all the postal codes in the area I had downloaded, and then compare those to the postal codes in the OpenStreetMap file. The first step was to find all the postal codes. I initially searched for Cleveland zip codes and found the United States Postal Service data for postal codes in Cleveland. However, after finding that an alarmingly large percentage of the post codes in the XML file were not in this list,  I realized that the area I had downloaded was a square and did not conform to the administrative boundaries of the city of Cleveland. My next approach was to examine the XML I had downloaded and find the latitude and longitude boudaries of the square. Then, using the [FreeMapTools](https://www.freemaptools.com/find-zip-codes-inside-user-defined-area.htm) post code finding tool, I was able to draw the exact box on a map and extract all the zip codes within the specified box. This yielded me 276 zip codes. I then compared the zip codes within the XML data to this set and extracted those that did not match as well as any problem zip codes such as {'44256:44321'} or 'OH 44312' which could not be converted to an integer. For the problem zip codes, if there were multiple codes separated by a colon, I took the first code as long as it was in the official list. For the zip codes outside of the geographic area, I decided to remove the tag entirely. The following code was used to perform the audit:\n",

    "#### Consistent Dates\n",
    "\n",
    "The last crucial issue I observed in my audit of the data was the inconsistent formats of dates used. All the timestamps automatically made when a user makes an edit of the OpenStreetMap are recorded as: timestamp=\"2009-05-21T03:59:40Z\". However, some of the dates under the secondary elements were in other formats such as \"06/05/2006\". Dates in this form can be intrepreted ambiguously, and I wanted all dates to be recorded in a consistent format so they could be more procssed and clearly understood in any data analysis performed on the set. In the entire Cleveland XML source data, there were 16320 dates in the non-standard (except for in the United States) MM/DD/YEAR format. Below is the code for the audit:\n",

The ISO 8601 basic date format is YYYY-MM-DD.\" Based on this information, I decided to adopt the [ISO 8601](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html) format for dates.

I manually resolved most of these issues and made a few alterations to the CSV files to ensure that all the data types matched what SQL expected. After successfully importing all the data into the tables, it was time to start the most rewarding phase of the project, _investigating the data!_ I formulated a few questions to guide my exploration of the dataset:\n",

The TIGER tag refers to the [Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing](https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tiger.html) database from the US Census Bureau that includes features such as roads and rivers.

The ways on the other hand, are composed of numerous nodes and often describe a route such as a highway or a trail that would be more likely to be found in a database. The relations usually describe a building or maybe a certain type of restriction such as no-left turn. Those would be less likely to be documented in a geographic database. Of course, there could be other databases besides GNIS and TIGER that I did not investigate, but this shows that a substantial portion of the ways in the Cleveland OSM data are based on verified features.

    "### Additional Ideas\n",
    "\n",
    "After observing the percentage of nodes, ways, and relations that have at least partially reference from a verified database, one potential idea to implement for the data would be to try and validate as many of the elements as is feasible. It should be possible to create a script that would read the XML file, and for each element, find the name tag of the feature and attempt to corroborate the information with an established database, whether that be GNIS, TIGER, or another option. For example, searching for \"Doan Brook\" in the GNIS database returns the following entry: \n",
    "\n",
    "\"Feature Name\"|\"ID\"|\"Class\"|\"County\"|\"State\"|\"Latitude\"|\"Longitude\"|\"Ele(ft)\"|\"Map\"|\"BGN Date\"|\"Entry Date\"|\n",
    "\"Doan Brook\"|\"1039725\"|\"Stream\"|\"Cuyahoga\"|\"OH\"|\"413230N\"|\"0813759W\"|\"577\"|\"Cleveland North\"|\"\"|\"12-JUL-1979\" \n",
    "\n",
    "This information could then be compared with the tags associated with \"Doan Brook\" in the OpenStreetMap and any incorrect user-entered information could be replaced with the validated data. This would be quite an undertaking for all of the elements in the original data, but it would vastly improve the quality of the data and reference it to a trusted source. \n",
    "\n",
    "The most intriguing aspect of the dataset to me was the skew in the percentage of edits made by users. I think it would be interesting to compare the quality of the data entered by bots compared to the quality of the data entered by users. Although bots should theoretically not make as many mistakes, they are programmed by humans, and an incorrectly designed bot could end up generating a large amount of \"dirty\" data with the creator never even realizing it. Humans users on the other hand, are slower but could potentially be more accurate and descriptive. Humans also have the advantage of being better able to judge the category a given feature should fall into and what tags should be associated with an element. Perhaps the best approach would be for bots to label the more straightforward features, such as nodes, and then have humans add in the details such as tags and descriptions that accurately model how the feature is used or experienced in the real world. These maps would not be possible to create in such detail without automated bots, but they occasionally need audits to ensure that the automated programs are not executing unintended actions. Moreover, humans are able to add nuanced data that even the most carefully programmed bot would never be able to figure out without having physically experienced the land being mapped. \n"

    "## Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, I was surprised by the quality of the original dataset. There was far less invalid, inaccurate, or problematic data than I was expecting. To take a single example, I only had to correct 9 problem elevations out of nearly 6500 elevation tags in the data. OpenStreetMap seems to be an accurate model of the actual world, as shown by [at least one study](ftp://ftp.cits.rncan.gc.ca/pub/cartonat/Reference/VGI/Dissertation-OpenStreepMap-Quality-Aather-2009.pdf). The quality of any open-source project is directly dependent on the users, and it is clear that the OpenStreetMap users care deeply about ensuring that the map they have collectively created is complete and accurate. Similar to how a community of users were able to create an online encyclopedia, Wikipedia, that is [nearly as accurate as professionally produced encyclopedias](https://www.cnet.com/news/study-wikipedia-as-accurate-as-britannica/), the OpenStreetMap community has generated a remarkably accurate map of the world. \n",
    "\n",
    "Judging the completeness of the data is difficult without going through the city feature by feature and ensuring that it is accounted for in the OSM. However, I think that as a metro area, Cleveland would tend to be more complete than rural areas. I would expect that larger cities have more complete and accurate datasets because of the higher concentration of users to enter data. I would imagine that the real challenge for the OpenStreetMap community is creating accurate maps of rural communities that have decreased access to data and a wide user base willing to update a map. Perhaps this is why bots could be of greatest use. They could use GPS data or satellite pictures, perhaps coupled with machine learning, to identify different geographical and architectural features that could then be validated by a human user.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This project was a great exercise in data auditing, cleaning, and analysis as well as the basics of creating and interacting with a SQL database. The next steps would be to actually implement the data cleaning by running the scripts on entire sections of the OSM data and then updating the map itself. OpenStreetMap is very consciously aware of [checking and improving the quality of the map](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Quality_assurance) and using automated tools, it should be possible to further improve on the relatively high quality of the Cleveland OpenStreetMap.
